= Hi there!

While creating this page, I decided to adopt and praise the simplicity of the Docs as Code concept.

The main concern was to represent the information as an eloquent brochure reflecting my personal interests. Hence you will find a certain amount of resources and writing variations on a vast range of topics.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the structure of this resource.

Reach me out via mailto:mzhirko@gmail.com[email,role=email] regarding any questions.
