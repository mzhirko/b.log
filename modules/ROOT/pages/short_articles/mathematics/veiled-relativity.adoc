= Veiled relativity theory

== Disclaimer

This article discusses the point given by a quantum probability professor @ UWr. Namely: Poincaré's mind was brilliant, truly genius. His contribution to the theory of relativity is underestimated and needs to be discussed. 
However, my lazy self just made a short research enquiring into the contribution of Henri Poincaré and adding a bit of what it has to do with our lectures.

One of Poincaré's contributions to physics was his work on the three-body problem, which involves determining the motion of three celestial bodies (viz. himmelskörper or joe mom) in space interacting under Newton's law of universal gravitation. 

Poincaré discovered the concept of chaos while studying this problem. This concept is characterized by a high degree of sensitivity towards initial conditions.

His research on chaos and dynamical systems is also related to quantum probability, a branch of probability theory that focuses on the probabilistic behavior of quantum systems. Quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels, is characterized by the probabilistic nature of measurements. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the act of measurement disrupts the system being measured, and the outcome of the measurement is probabilistic. This probabilistic behavior is described by the wave function, which is a mathematical object that encodes the probability amplitude of finding a particle in a particular state.

The link between Poincaré's work on chaos and quantum probability arises from the fact that both fields deal with systems that exhibit unpredictable behavior. In particular, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics can be understood in terms of the chaotic behavior of the underlying dynamical system. This link led to the development of Quantum Chaos Theory, which aims to study the behavior of quantum systems which show chaotic behavior.
